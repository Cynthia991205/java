## Introduction

In computing, **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types [[1](#reference-1)]. A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server. When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string. Parse the data with JSON Parser, and the data becomes a JavaScript object.

Recently, the amount of data transmitted by the network has soared. To process all the data before users feel a noticeable delay, the speed required for JSON Parser has been greatly increased and traditional parsers are too slow to meet demand.

In this context, **Didi Chuxing Technology Department** created **Jsoniter** to make JSON parsing faster and easier. Jsoniter Java version could be **3** times faster than jackson/gson/fastjson and Jsoniter Golang version could be more than **6** times faster than standard lib (encoding/json) [[2](#reference-2)]. Besides, Jsoniter gets things done, as fast as possible. Most common use case is just one line. Even better, it's easy to migrate from traditional parsers.

This chapter aims at analyzing Jsoniter as a software project based on viewpoints and perspectives defined by Rozanski and Woods [[3](#reference-3)]. First, the Stakeholders and Context view are analysed to provide insights into the organisation of the project. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the architecture is presented in order to understand its structure. In addition, technical debt in terms of code, testing and documentation was also found throughout the analysis of the system and is presented in the chapter. Finally, the chapter concludes with our findings of the project.

## Stakeholders

Using the stakeholder analysis categories in the book Software Systems Architecture: Working with Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives we have identified several groups of stakeholders in the json-iterator [[3](#reference-3)]. In the sections below we will identify the stakeholders by category.

*Table 1: Summary most important stakeholders.*

| Stakeholders | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Acquires         | Acquires can be seen as business sponsors. The founders of json-iterator are the ones that authorize funding for the products and system development. |
| Assessors        | Assessors are stakeholders that oversee whether legal constraints are complied with. We recognize developers' ownership of the open source repository. Another legal constraint that one could think of are the licenses that the dependencies of json-iterator have. Architectured in Java and go, these two companies have an impact on it. Finally, there are the licenses that json-iterator itself uses. These licenses have an effect on the users and potentially limit certain usages of the framework. |
| Communicators    | Communicators are experts’ system that explain the system (and its architecture) to others and additionally train the support staff of the system. Due to the lack of a dedicated support staff, the training thereof is not an applicable task in this project. Therefore, the first place to go to if   you want to obtain information about the system would be the user guide. Developers still leave GitHub addresses and their mailboxes for people to contact. |
| Users            | Users are the end users of json-iterator. They use json-iterator to parse Json. Json-iterator is fast and flexible JSON parser available in Java and Go. |
| Testers          | All bugs in the software can be emailed or issued on GitHub. Bugs and problems are picked up by the contributors on GitHub. |
| Developers       | In the case of json-iterator contributors are more than just developers. Contributors are also testers and maintainers. When contributing to this project, a developer has to test his or her own contribution before it is merged into the code base. A contribution can be the implementation of a new feature, but it can also be a bug fix, an update to the documentation or a refactor. Therefore, it differs per contribution what role a contributor has. The most outstanding contributor is [@taowen](https://github.com/taowen).  Twelve people, including [@plokhotnyuk](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk), [@caoli5288](https://github.com/caoli5288), [@ashutoshcp](https://github.com/ashutoshcp), [@elifarley](https://github.com/elifarley), [@Miha-x64](https://github.com/Miha-x64), also made their own contributor. |
| Support staff    | Json-iterator has no dedicated support staff. Whenever a user runs into problems, they have several options:<br />1. Consult the user guide: Developers   provide detailed user guide for users to refer to.<br />2. Send mail to developer: The main developer   leaves his contact mailboxes in both user manuals and open source websites.<br />3. Posting for help on major websites: There are many websites for developers to communicate with, and there will be many users of this project. So if you encounter problems, you can also post on the website for help. |
| Suppliers        | We have chosen to divide the suppliers of json-iterator into two different subcategories: the first category consists of the suppliers that are used for the development of json-iterator; the second category consists of suppliers that support the end use of json-iterator in some way.<br />1. Development suppliers: Java, Go.<br />2. End use suppliers: IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ), Maven/Gradle. |
| Maintainers      | Software solutions are assessed by the Software development team in order to maintain the programming standards and architectural choices. |

### Power Grid

The power/interest grid (see Figure 1) contains the main stakeholder categories. 

**High interest&High power:** ***Developers*** are the most important to manage, ***Maintainers*** come second as they have a hand in the evolution of the product.

**Low interest&High power:** ***Acquires*** and ***Assessors*** are relatively powerful because the system is dependent on their choices, but their interest is relatively low.

**High interest&Low power:** We have to keep ***Communicators*** and ***Testers*** very well informed to be able to perform their tasks. ***Users*** also have to be kept informed but have very limited power. 

**Low interest&Low power:** Finally, ***Development suppliers*** and ***End use suppliers*** can be monitored but do not require a lot of attention, as they have both low interest and power.

### Quality Attribute

Different stakeholders pay attention to different quality attributes. Here are some important quality attributes that stakeholders may pay attention to.

**Reliability and Performance :** These are the foundation of a good iterator, so all stakeholders will be concerned about these quality attributes.

**Modifiability:** Developers and maintainers will be very concerned about modifiability, because it determines their workload in improving the project.

**Usability and Availability:** For users, good availability and availability of this iterator is necessary, which determines whether they will continue to use it.

**Testability and Portability:** Good testability and portability to ensure the smooth progress of the tester's work.

## Context View

Now we will take look into the details of Jsoniter. This section shows the relations, platforms, dependencies and external entities that Jsoniter uses. By reading the analysis graph you can get a clear view of the interactions of Jsoniter.



### System Scope and Responsibilities



According to the creation and development of Jsoniter that has been written in its official website, we can learn that Jsoniter was initially created to make it faster and more flexible for developers to parse JSON.

> Jsoniter, which is also called json-iterator, is fast and flexible JSON parser available in JAVA and GO. Good deal of the code is ported from dsljson, and jsonparser.



It is commonly used in data transaction, focusing on parsing JSON, which is a light form of data exchanging. Traditional JSON parsers are slow, Jsoniter Java version could be 3x times faster than jackson/gson/fastjson. If one is doing a lot of log processing or number crunching, but stuck with JSON, he or she definitely needs to consider Jsoniter to save the encoding/decoding cost. What’s more, Jsoniter will not only be the fastest paser in runtime, bust also trying hard to be the fastest paser to help developers getting their job done.

> * Jsoniter is a JSON paser available in JAVA and GO.
>
> * Jsoniter is much faster than the traditional JSON paser.
> * Jsoniter develops to be used expediently.



A problem in developing is sometimes you program in one machine, but the next time you maybe program in another machine. Now the developing team try their best to make it easier to migrate.

> * Golang version is drop-in replacement for standard library(encoding/json), json.Marshal or son.Unmarshal just replace son with jsoniter.
> * Support gson compatibility mode.
> * Support Jackson compatibility mode.



Jsoniter functions focuses on parsing and improving efficiency. The responsibilities can be divided into .. aspects, as the following:

> * flexible: Jsoniter comes with three api for the different parsing job. Iterator-api is used when input is large. Bind-api is used for parsing bind value to object. And any-api is used for lazy parsing large object. Developers can mix and match, for example, bind-api+any-api. There are totally 6 combinations!
> * optional: The default decoding/encoding mode is reflection. But we can improve the performance by dynamically generated decoder/encoder class using javassist. Another option is static code generation, which is available in all platforms.
> * validation: Json can have more or less fields than the object. It is hard for the user to catch field not set condition, as the information will be lost after the binding. Jsoniter is one of the few son parsers has implemented required property tracking.
> * stream parsing: when dealing with large son input, we might want to process them in a streaming way. The developers found existing solution to be cumbersome, so Jsoniter is invented and improves it. )

### 2.External Entities

![](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/03/RxsTIXDO8P5qVZ9.png)

*Figure 2: Context view.*

#### Communication Tools

Josniter uses **GitHub** and **Git** for version control to help developers collaborate and track issues related to the parser. Contributerions in the repository come from Jsoniter development team, as well as from the open source community.

#### Development Tools

The developers are mainly development teamers and other contributors from the open source community. They develop many versions of Josniter. Among them, **Java** and **Go** are the mainly used languages.

Jsoniter has many versions on Android, so one of the most popular IDE used is **Android Studio**. And other Java IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** and **Eclipse** are used by development team. Of course, Java JDK is also important during development.

## Deployment View

The deployment view shows how software systems interact with the entire system, including hardware. It defines physical, computational, and software-based requirements for running the system. 

![](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/24/6P9nGYxufrI1qzW.png)

*Figure 3: deployment view*

**Runtime environment:** Jsoniter can be used in both Java and Go environments, but it should be noted that JDK 8+ is required when using it in Java environment.

**Memory required:** Aside from the memory required to install jsoniter from GitHub in the first place, no other hardware requirements for using jsoniter are mentioned anywhere. jsoniter requires around 1.33 MB of storage space to be installed. 

**Operation system:** Jsoniter can be used in any platform.

## Evolution View

Jasniter is a small tool that has only one version and has completed most of the functionality at the first release. There are only 16 releases in total, most of which are bug fixes.
